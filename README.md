## About
Most drum sequencers are rectangular, organizing notes linearly in a quantized grid. However, there are many rhythms that are difficult or impossible to construct this way (such as traditional African, Indian, and Indonesian drumbeats). These rhythms rely on repeating patterns of different lengths, which can vary in arrangement and timing.

Representing these grooves as overlapping cycles reveals their underlying patterns. This approach can also be used to explore and experiment with polyrhythms, syncopation, and beat construction.

## Project Structure

* `index.html` is the main entry point.
* `code/` has all the actual source code files, where `code/lib/` has all third-party libraries we're using.
* `assets/` is all the sound & image files.

And finally:
* `design/` is all the miscellaneous design notes, documents, and inspiration.

## Alternate Method for Running App
If you want to run the app locally, download or clone this repository. Make sure you have Python installed. Then double click on the `server.pythonX.bat` depending on your version of python, or if you're not on Windows, just run the command inside those files.  

This will run the server on localhost:8000 so just visit address that in your browser and you should be good to go!
