--- Brainstorming Ideas ---

1. Loading drum samples
    a. default samples
    b. drag and drop interface to add new samples
    c. sample managament interface
        - maximum number of samples at one time? (maybe like 8?)
        - drag unwanted samples to a recycle bin for removal?
        - 
    d. sample type detection (if file name contains 'kick', 'snare', etc.)
2. Drum machine interface
    a. concentric circles
        - 
    b. sample bank
    c. global controls
        - play
        - pause
        - reset beat
        - clear beat
        - master volume
        - master tempo
        - randomize?
    d. placing samples on circles
        - drag sample to circle, and release in place?
        - select an instrument and click the circle to place notes?
        - need some way to change/display individual note volumes
