--- Task List ---
- add lilting / non-linear traversal of orbit (by making orbit obilque)
- Figure out UI
    - design sampler menu
    - design music controls (tempo, play/pause, reset, master volume)
- Create a bottom bar for all the samplers
- create toggeable polar grid option, with note snapping
- create note volume sliders
- improve method for loading external svg data (using two.interpret) ?


Jon:
- play sample when sampler is clicked?
- create play/pause button


Omar:
- dynamic resizing window and content (!!!)
- custom audio files
	- importing new audio files via drag-n-drop anywhere on screen
	- assign new audio files to samplers (either new or preexisting)
	- some sort of feedback when this is done (ie sample plays, sampler animates, etc)
	- if file overwrites a preexisting sampler, make sure it's corresponding notes also play the new sample
- alt-click orbit to copy it


--- Done ---
- Render a small circle on screen (solid color)
- Render many small circles on screen, of varying radius
- Click and drag circles around screen
- Render larger circle outlines (no fill, just outline)
- Click larger circle and drag to change its radius
- Snap larger circle radius to a grid when released (ie integer units of radius; based on some defined unit variable)
- Make triangles work
	- Fix a triangle to a circle's path
	- Make it rotate forever based on a given speed
	- Make sure triangles on bigger circles take longer to rotate
- make accurate maths for triangle rotation, based on a global tempo
- make note circles draggable
- snap notes to orbits when close enough (with smooth tweening animation)
- update note's positions when orbit changes
- manage an orbit's notes with a list
- Add buttons ('samplers') for some pre-made samples
- Click and drag a sampler to create a note
- Create and drag in center to create new circle
- Drag note to center to destroy it
- Drag circle to the center to destroy
- Play a sound
- design orbit polygon and interactivity
    - draw a polygon within an orbit, using notes as vertices
    - update the polygon when the notes or orbit changes
    - grab the polygon to rotate it
    - make the polygon look good aesthetically
- Play sound when triangle hits note
- mute orbit by double click
- create a basic way to order objects by depth (https://github.com/jonobr1/two.js/issues/245)
- add subtle pulse animation to notes when played
- design volume slider
- make global volume and global tempo sliders
- button for toggling polygons
