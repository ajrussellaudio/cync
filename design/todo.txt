--- Ideas ---
- dynamic resizing window and content (important!!!)
- add lilting / non-linear traversal of orbit (by making orbit obilque)
- create toggeable polar grid option, with note snapping
- create note volume sliders
- simplify / refactor button and sliders
- simplify / refactor SetupInitialState()
- alt-click orbit to copy it
- redesign how orbits snap radii to be relative to one another, instead of absolute increments?


--- Bugs ---
#1 - When loading a state that had more samplers than the current state, some notes don't get samplers properly assigned
#2 - orbits do not resize appropriately after change page size and reloading


--- Done ---
- Render a small circle on screen (solid color)
- Render many small circles on screen, of varying radius
- Click and drag circles around screen
- Render larger circle outlines (no fill, just outline)
- Click larger circle and drag to change its radius
- Snap larger circle radius to a grid when released (ie integer units of radius; based on some defined unit variable)
- Make triangles work
	- Fix a triangle to a circle's path
	- Make it rotate forever based on a given speed
	- Make sure triangles on bigger circles take longer to rotate
- make accurate maths for triangle rotation, based on a global tempo
- make note circles draggable
- snap notes to orbits when close enough (with smooth tweening animation)
- update note's positions when orbit changes
- manage an orbit's notes with a list
- Add buttons ('samplers') for some pre-made samples
- Click and drag a sampler to create a note
- Create and drag in center to create new circle
- Drag note to center to destroy it
- Drag circle to the center to destroy
- Play a sound
- design orbit polygon and interactivity
    - draw a polygon within an orbit, using notes as vertices
    - update the polygon when the notes or orbit changes
    - grab the polygon to rotate it
    - make the polygon look good aesthetically
- Play sound when triangle hits note
- mute orbit by double click
- create a basic way to order objects by depth (https://github.com/jonobr1/two.js/issues/245)
- add subtle pulse animation to notes when played
- design volume slider
- make global volume and global tempo sliders
- button for toggling polygons
- improve tempo changing (changes tempo triggers all notes in a cacophony of noises)
- improve method for loading external svg data (using two.interpret)
- make play/pause button
- make reset button
- make reset button functional
- Figure out UI
    - design sampler menu
    - design music controls (tempo, play/pause, reset, master volume)
- fix glitch with notes not playing during first cycle when a setup is loaded (caused by trigger's theta values being less than -2PI when starting???)
- prototype a randomize feature
- play sample when sampler is clicked
- When randomizing, if a note is placed on an orbit, its sampler creates a ton of notes
- organize UI
	- placement of samplers relative to orbits for optimization
	- sample managment (loading new samples, viewing sample filename, deleting samples?)
	- global control buttons (play/pause, volume, tempo, reset)
	- maybe extra buttons in their own area/category? (like import, export, randomize, options?)
	- determine maxmium orbit number, maximum orbit radius
- MIDI exporting
    - create test MIDI file
    - add ability to download
    - translate cyclic drum groove into MIDI loop
    - make MIDI file download and playable in DAW
    - make save button in UI
- app logo
    - name and logo design
    - make svg text
    - clickable svg text links
    - UI design and interaction, polish
