Terrane Cyclic Drum Machine Project Notes

Project Goals:
    1. communicate the concept of grooves as cyclic structures
    2. encourage exploration of non-quantized, cyclic grooves

--- Brainstorming Ideas ---

Desired functionality:
- add, remove, and change radius of concentric circles
- have markers traverse the circles
- place notes on circles
- easily adjust/display a note's volume
- play notes when marker reaches them
- play, pause, reset circle markers
- clear all notes from circle
- clear all notes from all circles
- move a note around on a circle
- rotate all notes around on a circle (maintain separation but change location relative to other circles)
- default samples
- load custom samples (drag and drop)
- export groove
    - save file as multi-channeled MIDI
    - save file as uncompressed audio (.wav or .aiff) or compressed (.mp3 or .ogg)
    - save layout / sequence in a custom file for reloading later?
    - open custom file
    

Desired aesthetics:
- minimal text and numbers
- responsive interactions (smooth transitions, juicy animations)
- intuitive layout (symbols, layout, and design)
- emergent musical complexity


User Interface Design:
- web inputs
    - mouse hover
    - mouse click
    - mouse drag
    - mouse release
    - keyboard (desktop / laptop)
    - touch input and gestures (touchscreen / mobile)
    - webcam, microphone (unlikely, but they are available...)
- musicians vs non-musicians
- users who have experience with linear drum sequencers
- users who have never thought of drums as cyclic
- users who don't play video games or operate apps often (less understanding of layout and functionality)
- testers vs composers
    - testers will play around with the app for only briefly
    - composers will actually use the app to create music


Design issues:
- what if user wants two circles of same radius?
- what if the user imports a lot of samples? Should there be a limit? Or a list of all available?
-


Loading drum samples
    a. default samples
    b. drag and drop interface to add new samples
    c. sample managament interface
        - maximum number of samples at one time? (maybe like 8?)
        - drag unwanted samples to a recycle bin for removal?
        - 
    d. sample type detection (if file name contains 'kick', 'snare', etc.)

Drum machine interface
    a. concentric circles
        - all maths in polar coordinates?
    b. sample bank
    c. global controls
        - play
        - pause
        - reset beat
        - clear beat
        - master volume
        - master tempo
        - randomize?
    d. placing samples on circles
        - drag sample to circle, and release in place?
        - select an instrument and click the circle to place notes?
        - need some way to change/display individual note volumes
